# Environmental Rhizosheath Microbiome Sampling Protocol

This repository provides a **field and lab workflow** for collecting and processing **rhizosheath soil samples** for microbiome analysis (16S/ITS/shotgun metagenomics).  

It includes:
- A detailed **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)**
- A **1-page printable field sheet (PDF)** for use during sampling
- Metadata recording guidelines
- Notes on pitfalls, controls, and preservation

## 🌱 What is the Rhizosheath?

The **rhizosheath** is the soil that remains tightly adhered to plant roots after gently shaking off loose soil. It is distinct from:

- **Bulk soil**: ≥5–10 cm away from roots  
- **Rhizosphere**: loosely attached soil removed by gentle shaking  
- **Rhizoplane**: microbes on the root surface after sheath removal  
- **Endosphere**: microbes inside root tissue (after surface sterilization)

## 🧰 Materials Checklist

- Sterile nitrile gloves, masks  
- 70% ethanol spray + wipes  
- Sterile forceps, scissors/secateurs, spatulas, brushes  
- Sterile tubes (2 mL, 15/50 mL), Whirl-Pak bags  
- Preservation:  
  - **DNA only**: dry ice + cooler; later −20/−80 °C  
  - **DNA/RNA**: LifeGuard Soil, DNA/RNA Shield, RNAlater-Soil  
- Cooler with ice/dry ice, zip bags  
- Permanent marker, waterproof labels  
- Metadata sheets (paper or digital)  
- Sterile field blanks (air, tool, transport)

## 📋 Sampling Steps

1. **Pre-label tubes** with: project, site, date, plant ID, replicate, and fraction (“rhizosheath”).  
2. **Excavate roots** carefully (10–20 cm depth) keeping sheath intact.  
3. **Shake gently** to remove loose bulk soil. Collect bulk/rhizosphere separately if needed.  
4. **Scrape tightly adhering soil** (the rhizosheath) into sterile tubes.  
5. **Prevent contamination**: change gloves between plants, sterilize tools with 70% ethanol, and use blanks.  
6. **Preserve immediately**: keep cold on dry ice or add preservative. Record metadata.  
7. **Storage**: −80 °C (DNA) or per preservative instructions as soon as possible.

## 🗒️ Metadata to Record

- Site / GPS / Date / Time  
- Plant species (take photo if possible)  
- Root depth, soil type/texture, visible moisture  
- Temperature, sun/shade, recent rain/irrigation  
- Preservation method and time to cold storage  
- Operator / notes

## 🧪 Lab Processing

1. **Receipt & storage**  
   - Log samples and cross-check metadata.  
   - Store at −80 °C or as preservative guidelines recommend.  

2. **Rhizosheath cleanup**  
   - If root+sheath were collected, brush soil from roots in a sterile hood.  
   - Process roots separately for rhizoplane/endosphere if required.  

3. **Subsampling & extraction**  
   - Use ~0.25–0.5 g soil per extraction.  
   - Pool only within the same replicate (never across plants unless intended).  
   - Use bead-beating and inhibitor removal steps (rhizosheath often contains sticky polymers).  

4. **QC and downstream**  
   - Quantify DNA (Qubit), check purity (A260/280).  
   - For amplicons: use 16S primers (e.g., 515F/806R for bacteria/archaea).  
   - For shotgun: ensure ≥1–5 ng/µL high-quality DNA.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Fixes

- **Not enough soil**: target fibrous fine roots; pool segments if necessary.  
- **Cross-contamination**: enforce glove/tool changes; use field blanks.  
- **DNA inhibition**: bead-beat strongly; use inhibitor removal columns.  
- **Sandy soils**: treat remaining soil after minimal shaking as rhizosheath; document soil texture.  
- **Clayey soils**: pre-sieve gently in the lab to remove root debris.

## 📌 Notes

- Always follow local land access and biosecurity regulations.  
- Clean boots and tools between sites to avoid cross-contamination of soil biota.  
- Include **controls**: bulk soil, rhizosphere, blanks, and mock communities.
